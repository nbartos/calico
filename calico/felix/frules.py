Functions for generating iptables rules.  This covers our top-level
chains as well as low-level conversion from our datamodel rules to
iptables format.

iptables background
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

iptables configuration is split into multiple tables, which each support
different types of rules.  Each table contains multiple chains, which
are sequences of rules.  At certain points in packet processing the
packet is handed to one of the always-present kernel chains in a
particular table.  The kernel chains have default behaviours but they
can be modified to add or remove rules, including inserting a jump to
another chain.

Felix is mainly concerned with the "filter" table, which is used for
imposing policy rules.  There are multiple kernel chains in the filter
table.  After the routing decision has been made, packets enter

* the INPUT chain if they are destined for the host itself
* the OUTPUT chain if they are being sent by the host itself
* the FORWARD chain if they are to be forwarded between two interfaces.

Note: packets that are being forwarded do not traverse the INPUT or
OUTPUT chains at all.  INPUT and OUTPUT are only used for packets that
the host itself is to receive/send.

Packet paths
~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are a number of possible paths through the filter chains that we
care about:

* Packets from a local workload to another local workload traverse the
  FORWARD chain only.  Felix must ensure that those packets have *both*
  the outbound policy of the sending workload and the inbound policy
  of the receiving workload applied.

* Packets from a local workload to a remote address traverse the FORWARD
  chain only.  Felix must ensure that those packets have the outbound
  policy of the local workload applied.

* Packets from a remote address to a local workload traverse the FORWARD
  chain only.  Felix must apply the inbound policy of the local workload.

* Packets from a local workload to the host itself traverse the INPUT
  chain.  Felix must apply the outbound policy of the workload.

Chain structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Rather than adding many rules to the kernel chains, which are a shared
resource (and hence difficult to unpick), Felix creates its own delegate
chain for each kernel chain and inserts a single jump rule into the
kernel chain:

* INPUT -> felix-INPUT
* FORWARD -> felix-FORWARD

The top-level felix-XXX chains are static and configured at start-of-day.

The felix-FORWARD chain sends packet that arrive from a local workload to
the felix-FROM-ENDPOINT chain, which applies inbound policy.  Packets that
are denied by policy are dropped immediately.  However, accepted packets
are returned to the felix-FORWARD chain in case they need to be processed
further.  felix-FORWARD then directs packets that are going to local
endpoints to the felix-TO-ENDPOINT chain, which applies inbound policy.
Similarly, felix-TO-ENDPOINT either drops or returns the packet.  Finally,
if both the FROM-ENDPOINT and TO-ENDPOINT chains allow the packet,
felix-FORWARD accepts the packet and allows it through.

The felix-INPUT sends packets from local workloads to the (shared)
felix-FROM-ENDPOINT chain, which applies outbound policy.  Then it
(optionally) accepts packets that are returned.

Since workloads come and go, the TO/FROM-ENDPOINT chains are dynamic and
consist of dispatch tables based on device name.  Those chains are managed
by dispatch.py.

The dispatch chains direct packets to per-endpoint ("felix-to/from")
chains, which are responsible for policing IP addresses.  Those chains are
managed by endpoint.py.  Since the actual policy rules can be shared by
multiple endpoints, we put each set of policy rules in its own chain and
the per-endpoint chains send packets to the relevant policy
(felix-p-xxx-i/o) chains in turn.  Policy profile chains are managed by
profilerules.py.

Since an endpoint may be in multiple profiles and we execute the policy
chains of those profiles in sequence, the policy chains need to
communicate three different "return values"; for this we use the packet
MARK:

* Packet was matched by a deny rule.  In this case the packet is immediately
  dropped.
* Packet was matched by an allow rule.  In this case the packet is returned
  with MARK==1.  The calling chain can then return the packet to its caller
  for further processing.
* Packet was not matched at all.  In this case, the packet is returned with
  MARK==0.  The calling chain can then send the packet through the next
  profile chain.
