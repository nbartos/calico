# Changelog

- Add floating IP support (via 1:1 NAT) in Felix.
- Felix now parses the etcd snapshot in parallel with the event stream;
  this dramatically increases scale when under load.

## 1.2.1

- Fix Felix ipset exception when using IPIP.
- Use iptables protocol numbers not names.
- Fixes to diagnostics collection scripts.
- Pin networking-calico pip version.
- Really delete routes to ns-* devices in pre-Liberty OpenStack.

## 1.2.0

- Add liveness reporting to Felix.  Felix now reports its liveness into
  etcd and the neutron driver copies that information to the Neutron DB.
  If Felix is down on a host, Neutron will not try to schedule a VM on
  that host.
- Add endpoint status reporting to Felix.  Felix now reports the state of
  endpoints into etcd so that the OpenStack plugin can report this
  information into Neutron.  If Felix fails to configure a port, this now
  causes VM creation to fail.
- Performance enhancements to ipset manipulation.
- Rev python-etcd dependency to 0.4.1.  Our patched python-etcd version
  (which contains additional patches) is still required.
- Reduce occupancy of Felix's tag resolution index in the common case
  where IP addresses only have a single owner.
- Felix now sets the default.rp_filter sysctl to ensure that endpoints
  come up with the Kernel's RPF check enabled by default.
- Optimize Felix's actor framework to reduce message-passing overhead.
- Truncate long output from FailedSystemCall exception.
- Add instructions for use with OpenStack Liberty.

## 1.1.0

- Improve the documentation about upgrading a Calico/OpenStack system.
- Fix compatibility with latest OpenStack code (oslo_config).
- Use posix_spawn to improve Felix's performance under heavy load.
- Explicitly use and enable the kernel's reverse path filtering function,
  and remove our iptables anti-spoofing rules, which were not as robust.

## 1.0.0

- Add support for setting MTU on IP-in-IP device.
- Enhance BIRD configuration and documentation for graceful restart.

## 0.28

- Felix now restarts if its etcd configuration changes.
- Felix now periodically refreshes iptables to be robust to other processes
  corrupting its chains.
- More thorough resynchronization of etcd from the Neutron mechanism driver.
- Added process-specific information to the diagnostics dumps from Felix.

## 0.27

- Limit number of concurrent shell-outs in felix to prevent file descriptor
  exhaustion.
- Have felix periodically resync from etcd and force-refresh the dataplane.
- Stop restarting Felix on Ubuntu if it fails more than 5 times in 10 seconds.
- Move DHCP checksum calculation to Neutron.
- Get all fixed IPs for a port.

## 0.26

- Update and improve security model documentation.
- Streamline conntrack rules, move them to top-level chains to avoid
  duplication.
- Narrow focus of input iptables chain so that it only applies to
  Calico-handled traffic.
- Provide warning log when attempting to use Neutron networks that are not of
  type 'local' or 'flat' with Calico.
- Handle invalid JSON in IPAM key in etcd.
- Move all log rotation into logrotate and out of Felix, to prevent conflicts.
- Change log rotation strategy for logrotate to not rotate small log files.
- Delay starting the Neutron resynchronization thread until after all the
  necessary state has been configured, to avoid race conditions.
- Prevent systemd restarting Felix when it is killed by administrators.

## 0.25

- Remove stale conntrack entries when an endpoint's IP is removed.
- #672: Fix bug where profile chain was left empty instead of being
  stubbed out.
- Improve security between endpoint and host and simplify INPUT chain logic.

## 0.24

- Add Felix statistics logging on USR1 signal.
- Add support for routing over IP-in-IP interfaces in order to make it
  easier to evaluate Calico without reconfiguring underlying network.
- Reduce felix occupancy by replacing endpoint dictionaries by "struct"
  objects.
- Allow different hosts to have different interface prefixes for combined
  OpenStack and Docker systems.
- Add missing support for 0 as a TCP port.
- Add support for arbitrary IP protocols.
- Intern various IDs in felix to reduce occupancy.
- Fix bug where Calico may not propagate security group rule changes from
  OpenStack.
- Reduced logspam from Calico Mechanism Driver.

## 0.23

- Reset ARP configuration when endpoint MAC changes.
- Forget about profiles when they are deleted.
- Treat bad JSON as missing data.
- Add instructions for Kilo on RHEL7.
- Extend diagnostics script to collect etcd and RabbitMQ information.
- Improve BIRD config to prevent NETLINK: File Exists log spam.
- Reduce Felix logging volume.

## 0.22

- Updated Mechanism driver to specify fixed MAC address for Calico tap
  interfaces.
- Prevent the possibility of gevent context-switching during garbage collection
  in Felix.
- Increase the number of file descriptors available to Felix.
- Firewall input characters in profiles and tags.
- Implement tree-based dispatch chains to improve IPTables performance with
  many local endpoints.
- Neutron mechanism driver patches and docs for OpenStack Kilo release.
- Correct IPv6 documentation for Juno and Kilo.

## 0.21

- Support for running multiple neutron-server instances in OpenStack.
- Support for running neutron-server API workers in OpenStack.
- Calico Mechanism Driver now performs leader election to control state
  resynchronization.
- Extended data model to support multiple security profiles per endpoint.
- Calico Mechanism Driver now attempts to delete empty etcd directories.
- Felix no longer leaks memory when etcd directories it watches are deleted.
- Fix error on port creation where the Mechanism Driver would create, delete,
  and then recreate the port in etcd.
- Handle EtcdKeyNotFound from atomic delete methods
- Handle etcd cluster ID changes on API actions
- Fix ipsets cleanup to correctly iterate through stopping ipsets
- Ensure that metadata is not blocked by over-restrictive rules on outbound
  traffic
- Updates and clarifications to documentation
